C = Create a user with password and id is assigned dynamically.
R = Read the database and display in table in browser.
U = Update the username and password. the user will open the database click on a row of user and in side window the user and shown with the option of edit details.
there user can apply the changes and if the dataset is displaying in browser window update and re-render the database with new edited changes.
D = Delete the user from the database.

The UI will me made with tailwind CSS = i don't know tailwindcss and node.js
the backend is connected to postgresql and the server code is copied from internet and i understand it like 75% but i know what is going on but can not replicate the logic yet.

now tell me at this level out 10 how hard is this form me and how much days is it going to take so me who learn + code for 4 days in a week ?

### **What You Need to Learn for This Project**

Since you are a frontend developer and this is your first time working with the backend, you need to understand several key concepts. Below is a breakdown of what youâ€™ll need to learn, step by step.

---

### **1. Backend Basics (Node.js & Express)**

You need a backend server to handle requests from your frontend and fetch data from PostgreSQL.

- **Node.js** â†’ JavaScript runtime that allows us to run JS outside the browser.
- **Express.js** â†’ A minimal and fast web framework for Node.js that makes it easy to build APIs.
- **REST API** â†’ A way for your frontend and backend to communicate using HTTP requests.

#### **Learning Focus:**

âœ… Understanding how Node.js and Express work together.  
âœ… Setting up an API with routes (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`).  
âœ… Handling requests and sending JSON responses.

---

### **2. Database Connection & ORM (PostgreSQL + pg library)**

Your data is stored in PostgreSQL. You need to learn how to **connect to the database** and **fetch data from tables**.

- **PostgreSQL** â†’ Your database that stores the car inventory.
- **`pg` library** â†’ Node.js library to interact with PostgreSQL (run queries).
- **SQL Queries** â†’ Learn how to write SQL queries (`SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`).
- **Connection Pooling** â†’ Efficiently managing database connections.

#### **Learning Focus:**

âœ… How to connect a Node.js server to PostgreSQL.  
âœ… How to write queries to fetch and update data.  
âœ… How to send database results to the frontend as JSON.

---

### **3. Connecting Frontend & Backend (Fetching Data in React)**

Once the backend is ready, your React frontend needs to call the API to get data.

- **`fetch` API or Axios** â†’ Used in React to call backend APIs.
- **React State Management** â†’ Store and display data fetched from the backend.
- **Effect Hook (`useEffect`)** â†’ Fetch data when the page loads.

#### **Learning Focus:**

âœ… How to make API calls in React.  
âœ… How to store and display the fetched data.  
âœ… Handling loading states and errors.

---

### **4. Environment Variables & Security**

Your database credentials **must not** be hardcoded in your code.

- **`.env` files** â†’ Store sensitive information securely.
- **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)** â†’ Allows your frontend to communicate with the backend.
- **Error Handling & Debugging** â†’ Handling API errors and debugging requests.

#### **Learning Focus:**

âœ… How to store sensitive info securely.  
âœ… How to enable CORS for frontend-backend communication.  
âœ… How to debug issues when requests fail.

---

### **5. Hosting the App (Optional for Later)**

After everything works locally, youâ€™ll want to host your app online.

- **Backend Deployment** â†’ Platforms like **Render**, **Railway**, or **Vercel** for hosting Node.js servers.
- **Frontend Deployment** â†’ Platforms like **Vercel** or **Netlify** for React apps.
- **Database Hosting** â†’ You can use **Supabase**, **ElephantSQL**, or **Neon** to host your PostgreSQL database.

#### **Learning Focus:**

âœ… How to deploy a Node.js backend.  
âœ… How to deploy a React app.  
âœ… How to use a hosted database.

### **Next Step:**

If all of this makes sense, let me know and Iâ€™ll explain **Step 2** (the logic of how everything connects). ðŸš€
